         <p> When reality became too much, ELUNIA created an alternative existence. A singer-songwriter-producer executing all of her own visuals, the New Hampshire-based recording artist captures the endless meaning of human interaction as an immersive experience. Each track delves beneath the surface, with striking electronic textures, soaring melodies, and observant, probing lyrics.
         </p>
         <p> Although trained in music from an early age, it was the discovery of transforming feelings into creative entities that inspired the emerging songsmith to chart a different path. The multi-instrumentalist began writing and producing incessantly, hiding away in school practice rooms as a coping mechanism for the isolation she faced in the world around her. Fragments of thought noted in the midst of heart-wrenching moments evolved into ethereal, liquid atmospheres. Co-producing with multi-million streamed producer JMAC (Haux, Luz, Matilda Mann, Rosie Carney), the result is a flood of wild self-expression channeled through cinematic soundscapes.
         </p>

         ELUNIA’s sophomore anthem “Soak,” with its lush, crystalline palette, evokes a post-concert euphoria after a lifelong struggle with mental health. The single was met with high praise, described by CLOUT as “the definition of a banger” and EARMILK as “[leaving] you hanging off each word.”
